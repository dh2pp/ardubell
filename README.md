This project is for people who live in a flat and don't want to carry along their keys when they just leave home for shopping etc. You can simply use the Door bell button and type a pattern (compare Morse Code) and - provided that you have a remote unlock button from inside your flat - get the door unlocked automatically.

Code is working, but not nice :/ Hope to find some time to make it better (interrupt waking up from sleep, ...)

**Disclaimer**: Of course, this is not very secure but may be secure enough for the public front door to the stair case. I thought about a challenge response, but the only channel to transmit the challenge to the person at the front door is unlocking the door ^^ Feel free to share your thoughts/improvements in an issue.
