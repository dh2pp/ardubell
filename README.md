This project is for people who live in a flat and don't want to carry along their keys when they just leave home for shopping etc. You can simply use the Door bell button and type a pattern (compare Morse Code) and - provided that you have a remote unlock button from inside your flat - get the door unlocked automatically.

Please wait for the arduino code :)

**Disclaimer**: Of course, this is not very secure but may be secure enough for the public front door to the stair case.
